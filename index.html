I am Olly Burren currently a PhD student at the University of Cambridge UK, supervised by <a href="John Todd. 
I'm interested in the integration visually, statistically and computationally of genetic and genomics datasets. 
I have a BSc. in Biochemistry and an MSc. in Computer Science. 
Special thanks to my co-supervisor by <a href="http://chr1swallace.github.io/">Chris Wallace</a> who gives up her valuable time (and patience) to teach me statistics.
