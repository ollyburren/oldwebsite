I am Olly Burren currently a PhD student at the University of Cambridge UK,  supervised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Todd_(biologist)">Professor John Todd</a>. 
I'm interested in the integration visually, statistically and computationally of genetic and genomics datasets. 
I have a BSc. in Biochemistry and an MSc. in Computer Science. 
Special thanks to my co-supervisor <a href="http://chr1swallace.github.io/">Chris Wallace</a> who gives up her valuable time (and patience) to teach me statistics. I also am very grateful to my colleagues Ellen, Prem and Tim for all their support.
